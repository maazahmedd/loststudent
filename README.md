## Maaz Ahmed, Thais Alvarenga, Riley Ha, Chinonyerem Ukaegbu

### **Description**

It has been a really bad day for Mehani. All manner of troubles have come her way from the moment they woke up and the day seems to be getting worse and worse as it progresses. From missed appointments to stomach aches to even running head first into a glass door, folllow Mehani throughout the day and determine the sequence in which each of these events happened.

This video project leads the users to determining the sequence in which the unfortunate events take place. The users take on the role of a professor whose student came late for an important class and the users get to decide which videos they want to see as many times as they'd like in order to determine what happened and when. Clues are scattered throughout the videos and users would have to pay attention to these clues to determine the order.

### **Implementation**

+ **Starting Page**
  
  This page contains the introductory video providing context on the story and what is expected of the user. The video introduces the main character Mehani who comes late for a very important class and is to told to wait behind after class to explain what happened. The user can then navigate to the next page which will contain clues to help them decipher the order of events.

+ **Page 2: Floating Videos**
  
  The second page provides clues that will help the user determine the sequence of events. The page features 10 videos floating around, each video being a segment of the story and the user is free to watch the videos in whichever order they want and as many times as they want. When a thumbnail is clicked, a popup of the video associated with the thumbnail appears on the screen with a video. When the user is ready to progress, they can click the link on the bottom to navigate to the next page.
  

+ **Page 3: Determine the Sequence (Mini Game!)**
  
  This minigame allows the user to arrange chronologically the order of events. If an incorrect event is chosen, a sound file is played and a warning is issued and if a correct event is clicked, the event snaps into the sequence on the right and a sound file is played. When all 10 events have been arranged, a popup appears congratulating the user and providing a link to the final page, the conclusion of Mehani's story.
  
  
+ **Final Page; Ending Video**

  The final page features the ending video and the end to Mehani's story. In the video, we see Mehani pardonned for her lateness and excused from any penalties as it has really been a rough day for her. The user is able to play again or exit the website.



### **Reflection**

We found this project to be really exciting! It felt really cool handling all the cameras and sound equipment and determining what angles to take certain shots from and at some points it even felt as if we were taking a theater class. Filming and editing did take some time but it was interesting to see how even a little change made so much impact on how the final result looked like. The website was also really fun to work on and to not only implement a working website but also one that we felt conveyed the vibe of the project was a task we had fun doing. After this project, we do feel that we have gained a lot of skills and insight into the world of video editing and it was overall a very enjoyable experience.
